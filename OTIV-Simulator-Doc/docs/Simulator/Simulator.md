# OTIV Tram Simulator

The OTIV tram simulator is an advanced simulation platform developed using a custom fork of Unreal Engine 5.2 and Airsim. Designed to simulate a city environment with a primary focus on tram operations, this simulator is an essential tool for data collection and training purposes. It leverages state-of-the-art technology to create highly realistic urban environments, making it an invaluable resource for research and development in urban mobility and autonomous tram systems.

## Key Features

### Realistic City Generation
The simulator uses data exported from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** to generate an accurate representation of city streets, tram tracks, and navigation meshes for vehicles. While the streets and tram tracks are based on real-world data, the buildings are procedurally generated to align with the street layouts, ensuring a realistic yet flexible urban environment.

### Sensor and Camera Integration
A core aspect of the OTIV tram simulator is its ability to collect data from various sensors and cameras. This includes LiDAR, GPS, IMU, and multiple camera feeds, which are crucial for developing and testing autonomous tram systems. The collected data can be used for machine learning, computer vision training, and other research applications.

### Unreal Engine 5.2 and Airsim
By utilizing a custom fork of **Unreal Engine 5.2**, the simulator benefits from cutting-edge graphics and physics capabilities, providing a visually stunning and highly interactive simulation environment. **Airsim**, an open-source simulator for drones and autonomous vehicles, is integrated to enhance the simulation of sensor data and vehicle dynamics.

## Applications

### Training and Development
The OTIV tram simulator serves as an excellent platform for training purposes, enabling the development of autonomous driving algorithms in a controlled and realistic virtual environment. It supports iterative testing and fine-tuning of AI models before deploying them in real-world scenarios.

### Research and Data Analysis
Researchers can use the simulator to study various aspects of urban mobility, including traffic patterns, tram scheduling, and the impact of autonomous trams on city infrastructure. The high-fidelity data generated by the simulator provides a robust foundation for academic and industrial research.

### Safety and Efficiency
By simulating complex urban environments and potential real-world scenarios, the OTIV tram simulator helps in improving the safety and efficiency of tram operations. It allows for the testing of emergency protocols and the assessment of system robustness under different conditions.

## Customization and Extensibility

The simulator's modular architecture allows for extensive customization and scalability. Users can modify the city layout, introduce new sensor models, and implement custom vehicle dynamics to suit specific research needs or operational requirements.

## Conclusion

The OTIV tram simulator is a sophisticated tool that combines the power of Unreal Engine 5.2 and Airsim to create a highly realistic and versatile simulation environment. Its ability to generate detailed urban landscapes, collect comprehensive sensor data, and facilitate advanced research makes it an indispensable asset for the development of next-generation tram systems and urban mobility solutions.
