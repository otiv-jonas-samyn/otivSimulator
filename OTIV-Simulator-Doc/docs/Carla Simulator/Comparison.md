# Comparison

While Carla Simulator also works on Unreal Engine and was also made for autonomous vehicles just like Airsim, it does have a lot of difference with our Simulator, I will go over a couple of them.


## Visual comparison

Currently Carla Simulator runs on Unreal Engine 4.26, which is a bit older. This means that graphics wise it is quite a downgrade from our Simulator which runs on Unreal Engine 5.2.
But they are currently working on an upgrade where they will convert to Unreal Engine 5.3, which does allow for all the new visual upgrades like raytracing, lumen, as well as performance upgrades like nanite.
The planned release is around the summer of 2024 with updates coming in 2025, so the visual downgrade could be something that is no longer a problem.


## Data collection comparison
This is one of if not the most important part of the simulator, the data collection is everything from the different sensors, camera and how they interact with the world. Both Airsim and Carla Sim both have quite a bit of different kinds of data they can collect.
