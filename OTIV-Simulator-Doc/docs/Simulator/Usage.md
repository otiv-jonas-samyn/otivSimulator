# How to Use the Simulator

The simulator is built in Unreal Engine and exported as a simple `.exe` file that can run on any Windows 10+ device. Follow these steps to use the simulator:

1. **Configure Settings**
   - Modify the desired settings in the `settings_tram_sim.json` file. 

2. **Launch the Simulator**
   - Run the `.exe` file to start the simulator with the configured settings.

3. **Extract Output Files**
   - To extract output files, run the provided Python script. This script communicates with the simulator and exports files (configured with Airsim) to the designated output folder.

By following these steps, you can effectively configure, run, and extract data from the OTIV tram simulator.
